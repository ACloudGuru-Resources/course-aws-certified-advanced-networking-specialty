1) Create a VPC with /16 net mask
    - custom-vpc-acg
2) Create 6 subnets
    - 3 in AZa (public-subnet-clb-a, public-subnet-webserver-a, public-subnet-database-a)
    - 3 in AZb (public-subnet-clb-b, public-subnet-webserver-b, public-subnet-database-b)
    - Each should have CIDR range of /24
3) Create 6 route tables.
    - 
4) Assign each route table to each subnet.
5) Create 3 Security groups
    - SG1 -> For the CLB with Inbound rule of HTTP TCP 80 source from 0.0.0.0/0.
    - SG2 -> For the Webservers with Inbound rule of HTTP TCP 80 source from SG1.
    - SG3 -> For the RDS with Inbound rule of MySQL/Aurora TCP 3306 source from SG2.
6) Create an IGW and attach it to the VPC.
7) Create 2 Nat Gateways, one in each AZ.
8) Add entries to route tables:
    - 2 entries of 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW in the Route Tables associated with the public subnets.
    - 2 entries of 0.0.0.0/0 to Nat Gateway in AZa to the Route Tables associated with the subnets in AZa
    - 2 entries of 0.0.0.0/0 to Nat Gateway in AZb to the Route Tables associated with the subnets in AZb
